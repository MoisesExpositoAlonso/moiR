# Some handy R functions for an easier life and analyses
## Most functions fall in the next categories
* Plotting (I use base plot, but prefer ggplot2 and cowplot)
* Manipulation functions, such as writing functions or format functions
* Few wrap functions for common analyses: regression, contrasts, etc.

To get the package, just run (need devtools library)

``` sh
#install.packages("devtools") #uncomment if you don't have the library
devtools::install_github('MoisesExpositoAlonso/moiR')
library(moiR)

```
